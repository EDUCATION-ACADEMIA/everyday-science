<meta name="description" content="It is very likely that any organism on Earth will be either eaten by scavengers or decomposed by microorganisms after it dies. Organisms decompose more quickly when they are in contact with oxygen.1: the animal or plant must die. If a dead animal or plant is to become a fossil it must 2: become buried in sediment. Sometimes this happens fast (land/mudslide) and sometimes it happens slow (lake bottom).6. What are two reasons why many organisms never become part of the fossil record? Not all organisms are equally protected from destruction after death, are made of structures that fossilize well, or die in environments that are likely to lead to fossilization.Fossilization usually occur in organisms with hard, bony body parts, such as skeletons, teeth, or shells. Soft-bodied organisms, such as worms, are rarely fossilized.Why are organisms that are buried rapidly more likely to fossilize than those that are buried slowly or not at all? Rapid burial protects an organism from biotic factors such as scavengers and decomposers, and from abiotic factors such as sun and wind, allowing the fossilization process to begin.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It is very likely that any organism on Earth will be either eaten by scavengers or decomposed by microorganisms after it dies. Organisms decompose more quickly when they are in contact with oxygen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-1: the animal or plant must die. If a dead animal or plant is to become a fossil it must 2: become buried in sediment. Sometimes this happens fast (land/mudslide) and sometimes it happens slow (lake bottom).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-6. What are two reasons why many organisms never become part of the fossil record? Not all organisms are equally protected from destruction after death, are made of structures that fossilize well, or die in environments that are likely to lead to fossilization.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fossilization usually occur in organisms with hard, bony body parts, such as skeletons, teeth, or shells. Soft-bodied organisms, such as worms, are rarely fossilized.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Why are organisms that are buried rapidly more likely to fossilize than those that are buried slowly or not at all? Rapid burial protects an organism from biotic factors such as scavengers and decomposers, and from abiotic factors such as sun and wind, allowing the fossilization process to begin.
