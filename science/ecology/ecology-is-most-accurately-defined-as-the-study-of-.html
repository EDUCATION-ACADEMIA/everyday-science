The distribution and abundance of organisms on Earth is shaped by both biotic, living-organism-related, and abiotic, nonliving or physical, factors.The term ecology was coined by the German zoologist, Ernst Haeckel, in 1866 to describe the economies of living forms. The theoretical practice of ecology consists, by and large, of the construction of models of the interaction of living systems with their environment (including other living systems).At the coarsest level, ecological interactions can be defined as either intra-specific or inter-specific. Intra-specific interactions are those that occur between individuals of the same species, while interactions that occur between two or more species are called inter-specific interactions.">
