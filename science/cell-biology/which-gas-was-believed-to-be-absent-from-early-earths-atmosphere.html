<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Oxygen was absent in early earth atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Radon is the only radioactive out of all and it’s also not present in the Atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The oxygen did not build up in the atmosphere for a long time, since it was absorbed by rocks that could be easily oxidized (rusted). To this day, most of the oxygen produced over time is locked up in the ancient “banded rock” and “red bed” rock formations found in ancient sedimentary rock.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-(4.6 billion years ago) The surface was molten. As Earth cooled, an atmosphere formed mainly from gases spewed from volcanoes. It included hydrogen sulfide, methane, and ten to 200 times as much carbon dioxide as today’s atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The air was devoid of oxygen, and all that existed was molten lava flowing into the oceans. There were other chemicals in the air though, and these were supposedly washed down by rains into the ocean, and converted into a so-called organic “soup”. It was from here that life originated in a series of small steps.
