<strong> Which statement below correctly explains and gives the importance of the endosymbiotic theory? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The endosymbiotic theory states that the inner and outer membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum indicates these were once free living organisms which were taken into an early cell via endocytosis. The theory was further supported by the presence of prokaryotic ribosomes and replication of the endoplasmic reticulum via binary fission. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The endosymbiotic theory states that the inner and outer membrane of the mitochondria indicates these were once free living organisms which were taken into an early cell via endocytosis. The theory was further supported by the presence of prokaryotic ribosomes and replication of mitochondria via binary fission. 
</p>
<p>(C) The endosymbiotic theory states that through endocytosis, early prokaryotic cells were able to bring in additional nutrients. These additional nutrients provided important energy that drove evolution of these prokaryotic cells into the eukaryotic cells seen today in more advanced organisms. 
</p>
<p>(D) The endosymbiotic theory states that through endocytosis, early prokaryotic cells were able to bring in early energy rich eukaryotic cells. The energy provided drove evolution of these prokaryotic cells into the eukaryotic cells seen today in more advanced organisms.
