<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The first part states that all organisms are made of cells. The second part states that cells are the basic units of life. These parts were based on a conclusion made by Schwann and Matthias Schleiden in 1838, after comparing their observations of plant and animal cells.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In 1838, Matthias Schleiden, a German botanist, concluded that all plant tissues are composed of cells and that an embryonic plant arose from a single cell. He declared that the cell is the basic building block of all plant matter. This statement of Schleiden was the first generalizations concerning cells.

<strong>Concept note-4:

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Schwann concluded three things that became vital components of the cell theory. First, Schwann concluded that both plants and animals were composed of cells. Second, these cells have independent lives. Third, these independent lives are subject to the organismâ€™s life.
