Phloem is composed of various specialized cells called sieve elements, phloem fibres, and phloem parenchyma cells.Phloem (/ˈfloʊ. əm/, FLOH-əm) is the living tissue in vascular plants that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis and known as photosynthates, in particular the sugar sucrose, to the rest of the plant. This transport process is called translocation.The vascular system is comprised of two main types of tissue: the xylem and the phloem. The xylem distributes water and dissolved minerals upward through the plant, from the roots to the leaves. The phloem carries food downward from the leaves to the roots.Phloem: The soluble products of photosynthesis is glucose. Glucose is the organic nutrient which is produced in the plant and transported to all the plant cells. Glucose is transported throughout the body with the help of phloem which is a vascular tissue.Phloem is the vascular tissue which transports food from leaves to the other parts of the plant. Phloem is composed of various specialized cells called sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem fibers and phloem parenchyma cells.">
