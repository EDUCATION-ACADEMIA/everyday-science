<meta name="description" content="Perennials are plants which complete their life cycle in more than two years. Once they grow, they start to bear flowers, produce fruits, seeds and the cycle continues for a longer period of time. They do not die after bearing fruits but renew their parts, season after season.Once the plant has reached maturity the flower buds will develop into flowers. These flowers are important in a plants life cycle as this is where the new seeds are made. In other words, the flower is where reproduction happens. There are 2 key events involved in this stage, pollination and fertilisation.An annual plant is a plant that completes its life cycle, from germination to the production of seeds, within one growing season, and then dies.Annual plants complete their life cycle in one growing season. Biennial plants are planted in one year, grow through the year, grow on and flower during the next year. Perennial plants grow strong year after year. They germinate, grow, bear fruits and flowers, and die off in the same year.Perennial plants live more than two years and are grouped into two categories: herbaceous perennials and woody perennials.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Perennials are plants which complete their life cycle in more than two years. Once they grow, they start to bear flowers, produce fruits, seeds and the cycle continues for a longer period of time. They do not die after bearing fruits but renew their parts, season after season.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Once the plant has reached maturity the flower buds will develop into flowers. These flowers are important in a plantâ€™s life cycle as this is where the new seeds are made. In other words, the flower is where reproduction happens. There are 2 key events involved in this stage, pollination and fertilisation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An annual plant is a plant that completes its life cycle, from germination to the production of seeds, within one growing season, and then dies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Annual plants complete their life cycle in one growing season. Biennial plants are planted in one year, grow through the year, grow on and flower during the next year. Perennial plants grow strong year after year. They germinate, grow, bear fruits and flowers, and die off in the same year.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Perennial plants live more than two years and are grouped into two categories: herbaceous perennials and woody perennials.
