<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Elements and compounds are both examples of pure substances. Compounds are substances that are made up of more than one type of atom. Elements are the simplest substances made up of only one type of atom.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Compound. A compound is a pure chemical substance, but it is made from more than one type of atom, chemically bonded together. All pure substances are either elements or compounds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Compounds: A pure substance containing two or more kinds of atoms The atoms are chemically combined in some way. Often times (but not always) they come together to form groups of atoms called molecules. A compound is always homogeneous (uniform). Compounds cannot be separated by physical means.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Pure substances are substances that are made up of only one kind of particle and have a fixed or constant structure. Pure substances are further classified as elements and compounds. An element is a substance that consists of only one type or kind of atom.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Compounds are made of only one kind of molecule. The molecule is made up of two or more kinds of atoms. There is no physical change that can separate the compounds into more than one kind of substance. This makes a compound a pure substance.
