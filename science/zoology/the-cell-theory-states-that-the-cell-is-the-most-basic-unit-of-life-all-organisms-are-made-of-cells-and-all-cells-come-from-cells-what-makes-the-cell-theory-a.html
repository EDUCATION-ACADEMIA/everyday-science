<strong> The cell theory states that the cell is the most basic unit of life, all organisms are made of cells, and all cells come from cells. What makes the cell theory a scientific theory? 
</strong>
<p>(A) It is based on a scientific publication that is read by scientists worldwide. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** It is based on the work of many scientists and leads to accurate predictions. 
</p>
<p>(C) It is based on ideas that have been proven true and that are not subject to revision. 
</p>
<p>(D) It is based on preliminary evidence but sill needs to be confirmed with experiments.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The unified cell theory states that: all living things are composed of one or more cells; the cell is the basic unit of life; and new cells arise from existing cells. Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this theory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Cell Theory Is a Unifying Principle of Biology The cell theory states that all biological organisms are composed of cells; cells are the unit of life and all life come from preexisting life. The cell theory is so established today that it forms one of the unifying principles of biology.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-All living cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms. The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of independent cells. Energy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Cells are considered the basic units of life in part because they come in discrete and easily recognizable packages. That’s because all cells are surrounded by a structure called the cell membrane-which, much like the walls of a house, serves as a clear boundary between the cell’s internal and external environments.
