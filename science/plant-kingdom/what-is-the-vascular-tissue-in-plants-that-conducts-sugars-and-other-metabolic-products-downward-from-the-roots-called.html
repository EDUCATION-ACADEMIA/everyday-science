<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-phloem, plant vascular tissue that conducts foods made in the leaves during photosynthesis to all other parts of the plant. Phloem is composed of various specialized cells called sieve elements, phloem fibres, and phloem parenchyma cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Phloem is a highly specialised vascular tissue that forms an interconnected network of continuous strands throughout a plantâ€™s body. It transports sugars, nutrients, and a range of signalling molecules between leaves, roots, flowers, and fruits. As a result, phloem is central to plant function.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Phloem tissue, which transports organic compounds from the site of photosynthesis to other parts of the plant, consists of sieve cells and companion cells. Sieve cells conduct sugars and other organic compounds, and are arranged end-to-end with pores called sieve plates between them to allow movement between cells.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Phloem, also called bast, is a vascular tissue that runs through all the organs of plants. It transports sugars formed in the leaves during photosynthesis.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Phloem is the vascular tissue which transports food from leaves to the other parts of the plant. Phloem is composed of various specialized cells called sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem fibers and phloem parenchyma cells.
