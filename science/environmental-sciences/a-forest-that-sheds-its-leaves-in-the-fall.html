<meta name="description" content="A forest characterized by trees or plants, shedding its leaves annually is known as a deciduous forest. Plants like mosses, herbs, and ferns are found in these forests. Deciduous forests are mainly observed in North America, Europe, and Asia.Complete answer: In temperate forests in the Northern Hemisphere, trees shed their leaves during autumn as a cold season. In tropical and subtropical forests, trees shed their leaves at the beginning of the dry season. Many types of trees shed their leaves as a strategy to avoid harsh weather conditions.The leaves of the deciduous trees have a tendency to lose water. But during the dry season, water is scarce. Hence, deciduous trees shed their leaves to prevent water loss.Temperate deciduous forests or temperate broad-leaf forests are dominated by trees that lose their leaves each year. Temperate deciduous forests are located in the mid-latitude areas which means that they are found between the polar regions and the tropics.Temperate deciduous or temperate broad-leaf forests are a variety of temperate forest dominated by trees that lose their leaves each year.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A forest characterized by trees or plants, shedding its leaves annually is known as a deciduous forest. Plants like mosses, herbs, and ferns are found in these forests. Deciduous forests are mainly observed in North America, Europe, and Asia.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Complete answer: In temperate forests in the Northern Hemisphere, trees shed their leaves during autumn as a cold season. In tropical and subtropical forests, trees shed their leaves at the beginning of the dry season. Many types of trees shed their leaves as a strategy to avoid harsh weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The leaves of the deciduous trees have a tendency to lose water. But during the dry season, water is scarce. Hence, deciduous trees shed their leaves to prevent water loss.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Temperate deciduous forests or temperate broad-leaf forests are dominated by trees that lose their leaves each year. Temperate deciduous forests are located in the mid-latitude areas which means that they are found between the polar regions and the tropics.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Temperate deciduous or temperate broad-leaf forests are a variety of temperate forest ‘dominated’ by trees that lose their leaves each year. They are found in areas with warm moist summers and cool winters.
