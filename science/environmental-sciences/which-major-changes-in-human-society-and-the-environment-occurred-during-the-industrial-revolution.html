<p>(B) Domesticated plants were altered; forest was replaced with farmland 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Fossil fuel consumption, technological efficiency, and environmental pollution increased 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The Industrial Revolution saw an increased use of fossil fuels, including coal. The burning of coal releases greenhouse gases into the environment, which trap heat and contribute to global climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Which major changes in human society and the environment occurred during the Industrial Revolution? Fossil fuel consumption, technological efficiency, and environmental pollution increased.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Industrial Revolution shifted from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing economy where products were no longer made solely by hand but by machines. This led to increased production and efficiency, lower prices, more goods, improved wages, and migration from rural areas to urban areas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Human activity has rapidly increased the emission of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, in about 1750, human activities such as burning fossil fuels, including coal and oil, have increased greenhouse gas concentrations in our atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Industrial Revolution was energized by coal and eventually by petroleum and natural gas. Fossil fuels that drive steam and electrical engines made possible a huge increase in the amount of productive energy available to humans.
