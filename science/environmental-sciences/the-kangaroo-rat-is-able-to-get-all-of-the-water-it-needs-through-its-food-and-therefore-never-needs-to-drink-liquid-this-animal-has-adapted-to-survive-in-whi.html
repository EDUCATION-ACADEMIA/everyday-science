</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Kangaroo rats needs very little water to survive and can receive all the moisture it needs from plants. Kangaroo rats do not sweat or pant like other animals to keep cool. They have a very unique metabolism and specialized kidneys that allow them to survive without drinking water or consuming leaves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Adaptations. The kangaroo rat is almost perfectly adapted to life in the desert. They can survive without ever drinking any water, getting needed moisture from their seed diet. They have excellent hearing and can even detect the silent sound of an owl approaching.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Kangaroo rats can survive in deserts without ever drinking. The kangaroo rat has nearly perfect adaptations to desert life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Kangaroo rats are well adapted to desert life. They do not sweat, suggesting that they conserve water. Kangaroo rats stay in burrows in order to stay cool during the day and come out at night. They are not required to drink water, having any moisture they require from the seeds they eat.
