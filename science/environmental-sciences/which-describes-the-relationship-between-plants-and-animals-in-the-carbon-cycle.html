<title>Which describes the relationship between plants and animals in the carbon cycle?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Answer: Solution: Animals, during respiration, take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide gas. Plants, on the other hand, utilize this carbon dioxide gas in the process of photosynthesis to produce food and release oxygen in the atmosphere.Through the process of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is pulled from the air to produce food made from carbon for plant growth. Carbon moves from plants to animals. Through food chains, the carbon that is in plants moves to the animals that eat them. Animals that eat other animals get the carbon from their food too.For example, in the food chain, plants move carbon from the atmosphere into the biosphere through photosynthesis. They use energy from the sun to chemically combine carbon dioxide with hydrogen and oxygen from water to create sugar molecules.When theyre exposed to light, green plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to manufacture living matter and release oxygen into the air. This process is called photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide is produced through the respiration of animals and plants, which consume oxygen and release carbon dioxide.The correct option is C) Plants produce O2 and sugars and animals produce CO2 and H2 O. This statement best describe the relationship between plant and animals on earth as plant are autotrophs and they can produce sugar and oxygen with the help of carbon dioxide and water molecule in presence of sunlight.">
