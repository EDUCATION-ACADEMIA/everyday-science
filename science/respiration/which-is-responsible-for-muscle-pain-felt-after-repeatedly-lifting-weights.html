<meta name="description" content="Lactic Acid Buildup Causes Muscle Fatigue and Soreness. Anyone who has pushed themselves through an intense workout will be familiar with feeling the burn-that sensation of fatigue and pain that sets in when you subject your muscles to lifting heavy loads repeatedly or sprinting all-out.Most likely, your muscles get sore because exercises causes microscopic tears in the tissue, which causes inflammation and a heightened sense of pain. The good news (and more proof that lactic acid buildup isnt to blame) is that the more you do an exercise, the less sore youll feel thanks to the repeated bout effect.Lactic acid is a by-product of anaerobic glycolysis and anaerobic metabolism, which occur during strenuous exercise. Although lactic acid is used as a fuel by the heart, an excessive amount of lactic acid in your muscles slows down contractions, preventing you from maintaining peak performance.The lactate and hydrogen ion are no longer attached and present as lactic acid, but they are both present separately in the body as lactate and a hydrogen ion. The lactate is often recycled and used as energy, which is much needed during bouts of intense exercise.That means anaerobic exercise must be fueled using glucose through a process called glycolysis. Glycolysis occurs in muscle cells during high-intensity training without oxygen, producing energy quickly. This process also produces lactic acid, which is the reason why your muscles get so tired after the energy burst.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Lactic Acid Buildup Causes Muscle Fatigue and Soreness. Anyone who has pushed themselves through an intense workout will be familiar with “feeling the burn”-that sensation of fatigue and pain that sets in when you subject your muscles to lifting heavy loads repeatedly or sprinting all-out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Most likely, your muscles get sore because exercises causes microscopic tears in the tissue, which causes inflammation and a heightened sense of pain. The good news (and more proof that lactic acid buildup isn’t to blame) is that the more you do an exercise, the less sore you’ll feel thanks to the repeated bout effect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Lactic acid is a by-product of anaerobic glycolysis and anaerobic metabolism, which occur during strenuous exercise. Although lactic acid is used as a fuel by the heart, an excessive amount of lactic acid in your muscles slows down contractions, preventing you from maintaining peak performance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The lactate and hydrogen ion are no longer attached and present as lactic acid, but they are both present separately in the body as lactate and a hydrogen ion. The lactate is often recycled and used as energy, which is much needed during bouts of intense exercise.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-That means anaerobic exercise must be fueled using glucose through a process called glycolysis. Glycolysis occurs in muscle cells during high-intensity training without oxygen, producing energy quickly. This process also produces lactic acid, which is the reason why your muscles get so tired after the energy burst.
