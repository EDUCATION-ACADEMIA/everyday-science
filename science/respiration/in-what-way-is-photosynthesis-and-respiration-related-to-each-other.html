<title>In what way is photosynthesis and respiration related to each other?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="They are related also because they are dependent on each other. The product of photosynthesis i.e., glucose (food) is utilised in respiration to yield energy (ATP). Which doing so, it releases many other simple molecules (CO2+H2O) which are utilised in photosynthesis to produce more sugers. Q.The products and reactants for photosynthesis are reversed in cellular respiration: The reactants of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water, which are the products of cellular respiration. The reactants of cellular respiration are oxygen and sugar, which are the products of photosynthesis.The end product of Photosynthesis is glucose that is used in cellular respiration to make ATP. The glucose is then turned back into carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. While water is broken down to form oxygen during photosynthesis, in cellular respiration oxygen is combined with hydrogen to form water.Photosynthesis makes glucose which is used in cellular respiration for making ATP. The glucose is then transformed back into carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. It helps cells to release and store energy. It maintains the atmospheric balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen.Plants release oxygen which is a by-product of photosynthesis, and we breathe in oxygen so that our cells can carry out cellular respiration and generate ATP. Respiration and photosynthesis are biological reactions in the environment that complement each other.">
