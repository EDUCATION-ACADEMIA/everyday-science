<meta name="description" content="As the cells run out of oxygen, they die off gradually and the weightlifters muscles have fewer contracting muscle cells. As the cells run out of oxygen they switch to anaerobic respiration, which allows the cell to make small amounts of ATP in the absence of oxygen.A weightlifter is using heavy weights in short bursts for a competition. Because his muscle cells are not able to take in enough oxygen to make very much ATP the weightlifter begins to get fatigue in his muscles.When your body runs out of oxygen, or your other systems cant deliver oxygen to your muscles quickly enough, your muscles convert the available glucose into lactic acid instead.This anaerobic breakdown of glucose leads to the formation of lactic acid in muscles. The accumulation of lactic acid in muscles leads to muscle cramps. Hence During heavy exercise, we get cramps in the legs due to the accumulation of Lactic acid. So, the correct answer is Lactic acid.Final answer: Sometimes when we do heavy exercise, anaerobic respiration takes place in our muscle cells. Lactic acid is produced during this process.">

<strong> A weightlifter is using heavy weights in short bursts for a competition.

<p>(A) ** As the cells run out of oxygen they switch to anaerobic respiration, which allows the cell to make small amounts of energy in the absence of oxygen. 
</p>
<p>(B) As the cells run out of oxygen, they die off gradually and the weightlifter’s muscles have fewer contracting muscle cells. 
</p>
<p>(C) The cells will never run out of oxygen if the weightlifter is breathing. 
</p>
<p>(D) As the cells run out of oxygen, they will continue to make the same amount of energy, since oxygen is not required to make energy.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-As the cells run out of oxygen, they die off gradually and the weightlifter’s muscles have fewer contracting muscle cells. As the cells run out of oxygen they switch to anaerobic respiration, which allows the cell to make small amounts of ATP in the absence of oxygen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A weightlifter is using heavy weights in short bursts for a competition. Because his muscle cells are not able to take in enough oxygen to make very much ATP the weightlifter begins to get fatigue in his muscles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When your body runs out of oxygen, or your other systems can’t deliver oxygen to your muscles quickly enough, your muscles convert the available glucose into lactic acid instead.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This anaerobic breakdown of glucose leads to the formation of lactic acid in muscles. The accumulation of lactic acid in muscles leads to muscle cramps. Hence During heavy exercise, we get cramps in the legs due to the accumulation of Lactic acid. So, the correct answer is ‘Lactic acid’.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Final answer: Sometimes when we do heavy exercise, anaerobic respiration takes place in our muscle cells. Lactic acid is produced during this process.
