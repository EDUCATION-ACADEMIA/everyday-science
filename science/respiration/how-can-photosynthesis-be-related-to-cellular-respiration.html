<title>How can photosynthesis be related to cellular respiration?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. Glucose is used as food by the plant and oxygen is a by-product. Cellular respiration converts oxygen and glucose into water and carbon dioxide. Water and carbon dioxide are by-products and ATP is energy that is transformed from the process.Photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, and cellular respiration releases the energy from glucose to build ATP, which does the work of life. Moreover, photosynthesis reactants CO2 and H2O are products of cellular respiration.The products and reactants for photosynthesis are reversed in cellular respiration: The reactants of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water, which are the products of cellular respiration. The reactants of cellular respiration are oxygen and sugar, which are the products of photosynthesis.Photosynthesis makes glucose and oxygen, which are then used as the starting products for cellular respiration. Cellular respiration makes carbon dioxide and water (and ATP), which are the starting products (together with sunlight) for photosynthesis.Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are dependent on each other as the products of each of these reactions initiate the other reaction. The sugar molecules or glucose molecules produced in the reaction of photosynthesis are used as reactant molecules in the respiration reaction.">

<strong> How can photosynthesis be related to cellular respiration? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** Whatâ€™s produced (made) by one is needed (the reactants) for the other 
</p>
<p>(B) They both produce the same products 
</p>
<p>(C) They both have the same reactants (need the same things) 
</p>
<p>(D) These 2 processes have nothing in common 
</p>

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. Glucose is used as food by the plant and oxygen is a by-product. Cellular respiration converts oxygen and glucose into water and carbon dioxide. Water and carbon dioxide are by-products and ATP is energy that is transformed from the process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, and cellular respiration releases the energy from glucose to build ATP, which does the work of life. Moreover, photosynthesis reactants CO2 and H2O are products of cellular respiration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The products and reactants for photosynthesis are reversed in cellular respiration: The reactants of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water, which are the products of cellular respiration. The reactants of cellular respiration are oxygen and sugar, which are the products of photosynthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Photosynthesis makes glucose and oxygen, which are then used as the starting products for cellular respiration. Cellular respiration makes carbon dioxide and water (and ATP), which are the starting products (together with sunlight) for photosynthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are dependent on each other as the products of each of these reactions initiate the other reaction. The sugar molecules or glucose molecules produced in the reaction of photosynthesis are used as reactant molecules in the respiration reaction.
