<title>Why are dwarf planets not considered as a regular planet?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="What differentiates a dwarf planet from a planet? For the most part, they are identical, but theres one key difference: A dwarf planet hasnt cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, which means it has not become gravitationally dominant and it shares its orbital space with other bodies of a similar size.A dwarf planet, by IAUs new definition, must directly orbit the Sun. It must be massive enough for gravity to pull it into a roughly spherical shape. But unlike regular planets, dwarf planets havent cleared other smaller celestial debris out of its orbital path.According to the International Astronomical Union, which sets definitions for planetary science, a dwarf planet is a celestial body that-orbits the sun, has enough mass to assume a nearly round shape, has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit and is not a moon.You may wonder what that means, not clearing its neighboring region of other objects? This means that the planet has become gravitationally dominant and there are no other bodies of comparable size other than its satellites.Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet because, while it is large enough to have become spherical, it is not big enough to exert its orbital dominance and clear the neighborhood surrounding its orbit.">

<strong> Why are dwarf planets not considered as a regular planet? 
</strong>
<p>(A) It is not orbiting around a star 
</p>
<p>(B) It has no sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium 
</p>
<p>(C) ** It has not cleared its neighboring regions of other objects 
</p>
<p>(D) It is not spherical enough

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-What differentiates a dwarf planet from a planet? For the most part, they are identical, but there’s one key difference: A dwarf planet hasn’t “cleared the neighborhood” around its orbit, which means it has not become gravitationally dominant and it shares its orbital space with other bodies of a similar size.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A dwarf planet, by IAU’s new definition, must directly orbit the Sun. It must be massive enough for gravity to pull it into a roughly spherical shape. But unlike regular planets, dwarf planets haven’t cleared other smaller celestial debris out of its orbital path.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-According to the International Astronomical Union, which sets definitions for planetary science, a dwarf planet is a celestial body that-orbits the sun, has enough mass to assume a nearly round shape, has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit and is not a moon.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-You may wonder what that means, “not clearing its neighboring region of other objects?” This means that the planet has become gravitationally dominant and there are no other bodies of comparable size other than its satellites.

<strong>Concept note-5:
