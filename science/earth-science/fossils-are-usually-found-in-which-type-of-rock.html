<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Fossils are commonly found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks are the most common type of rock since they are formed by the earth’s natural forces like wind and water. Q. Sometimes igneous and sedimentary rocks are changed into metamorphic rocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks and occasionally some fine-grained, low-grade metamorphic rocks. Sometimes the fossils have been removed, leaving moulds in the surrounding rock, or the moulds may have later been filled by other materials, forming casts of the original fossils.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Therefore, fossils are found in sedimentary rock, like sandstone, shale, limestone and coal. Igneous rock, like granite and basalt, is formed by molten rock erupting from deep within the earth. Metamorphic rock, such as marble, is formed by tremendous heat and pressure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Sedimentary rocks have the ability to retain fossils because unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, sedimentary rocks occurs at temperatures and pressure that do not obliterate fossil remnants. Therefore, fossils are found in sedimentary rocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Fossils are most common in limestones. That is because most limestones consist partly or mostly of the shells of organisms. Sometimes, however, the shells are worn so much that they look like sediment grains rather than “real” fossils. Fossils are also common in shales, which form from muds.
