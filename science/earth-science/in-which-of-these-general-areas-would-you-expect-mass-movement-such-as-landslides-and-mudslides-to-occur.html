This mass movement typically occurs along hillsides and mountains due to the influence of gravity and can happen very slowly or very quickly.Steep slopes and areas at the bottom of slopes or canyons; Slopes that have been altered for construction of buildings and roads; Channels along a stream or river; and. Areas where surface runoff is directed.Landslides and avalanches are among the major hydro-geological hazards that affect large parts of India besides the Himalayas, the Northeastern hill ranges, the Western Ghats, the Nilgiris, the Eastern Ghats and the Vindhyans, in that order, covering about 15 % of the landmass.Seismic tremors can trigger landslides on slopes historically known to have landslide movement. Earthquakes can also cause additional failure (lateral spreading) that can occur on gentle slopes above steep streams and riverbanks.Lahars. Lahars, also known as volcanic mudflows, are hot or cold mixtures of water, rock, sand, and mud moving down the flanks of a volcano and running away from it. Lahars look like fast-moving masses of wet concrete that carry tephra ranging in size from a few millimeters to more than 10 m in diameter.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Mass movement, often called mass wasting, is the downslope movement of a mass of surface materials, such as soil, rock or mud. This mass movement typically occurs along hillsides and mountains due to the influence of gravity and can happen very slowly or very quickly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Steep slopes and areas at the bottom of slopes or canyons; Slopes that have been altered for construction of buildings and roads; Channels along a stream or river; and. Areas where surface runoff is directed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Landslides and avalanches are among the major hydro-geological hazards that affect large parts of India besides the Himalayas, the Northeastern hill ranges, the Western Ghats, the Nilgiris, the Eastern Ghats and the Vindhyans, in that order, covering about 15 % of the landmass.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Seismic tremors can trigger landslides on slopes historically known to have landslide movement. Earthquakes can also cause additional failure (lateral spreading) that can occur on gentle slopes above steep streams and riverbanks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Lahars. Lahars, also known as volcanic mudflows, are hot or cold mixtures of water, rock, sand, and mud moving down the flanks of a volcano and running away from it. Lahars look like fast-moving masses of wet concrete that carry tephra ranging in size from a few millimeters to more than 10 m in diameter.
