<title>Would you weigh more or less on Jupiter than you would on Earth?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Jupiter is a massive planet, the biggest in our solar system, and it has a stronger gravitational pull than Earth. In fact, its gravity is about 2.4 times as strong as Earths. This means, if you weigh 40 kg (88 lbs) on Earth you would weigh 94 kg (207 lbs) on Jupiter.The gravity on Jupiter is greater than the gravity on Earth because Jupiter is more massive. Although Jupiter is a great deal larger in size, its surface gravity is just 2.4 times that of the surface gravity of Earth.The gas giant is approximately 318 times as massive as Earth, according to planetary scientist Alan Boss (opens in new tab). If the mass of all of the other planets in the solar system were combined into one super planet, Jupiter would still be two and a half times as large.Larger planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, have stronger gravitational pulls, which means youd weigh more if you visited those planets. Since the Moon is smaller than Earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull.Thats because the planets weigh different amounts, and therefore the force of gravity is different from planet to planet. For example, if you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh only 38 pounds on Mercury. Thats because Mercury weighs less than Earth, and therefore its gravity would pull less on your body.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Jupiter is a massive planet, the biggest in our solar system, and it has a stronger gravitational pull than Earth. In fact, its gravity is about 2.4 times as strong as Earth’s. This means, if you weigh 40 kg (88 lbs) on Earth you would weigh 94 kg (207 lbs) on Jupiter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The gravity on Jupiter is greater than the gravity on Earth because Jupiter is more massive. Although Jupiter is a great deal larger in size, its surface gravity is just 2.4 times that of the surface gravity of Earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The gas giant is approximately 318 times as massive as Earth, according to planetary scientist Alan Boss (opens in new tab). If the mass of all of the other planets in the solar system were combined into one “super planet, ” Jupiter would still be two and a half times as large.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Larger planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, have stronger gravitational pulls, which means you’d weigh more if you visited those planets. Since the Moon is smaller than Earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-That’s because the planets weigh different amounts, and therefore the force of gravity is different from planet to planet. For example, if you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh only 38 pounds on Mercury. That’s because Mercury weighs less than Earth, and therefore its gravity would pull less on your body.
