<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Light intensity influences the manufacture of plant food, stem length, leaf color and flowering. Generally speaking, plants grown in low light tend to be spindly with light green leaves. A similar plant grown in very bright light tends to be shorter, better branches, and have larger, dark green leaves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Well, the research is going to change the amount of sunlight, so the amount of sunlight or varying the amount of sunlight is the independent variable because we’re trying to determine the effect of the sunlight on plant growth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>–The leaf which turned blue-black is a leaf which is placed in sunlight, and photosynthesis occurred and starch was produced.-So starch is produced only in the leaves which are exposed to sunlight, and this proves that sunlight is very essential for plants to do photosynthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An apparatus called the auxanometer can be used to measure plant growth. Measuring the height of the plant. Checking the size and number of the leaves. Evaluating the rate of growth with that of fresh plants. Comparing the rate of growth with dried plants.
