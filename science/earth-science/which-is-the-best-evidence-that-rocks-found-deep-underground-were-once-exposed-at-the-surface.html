<meta name="description" content="Q. Which is the BEST evidence that rocks found deep underground were once exposed at the surface? The rocks have been melted by a magma.Once exposed, they are weathered, both physically (by mechanical breaking of the rock) and chemically (by weathering of the minerals), and the weathering products-mostly small rock and mineral fragments-are eroded, transported, and then deposited as sediments.Water, ice, acids, salts, plants, animals, and changes in temperature are all agents of weathering. Once a rock has been broken down, a process called erosion transports the bits of rock and mineral away. No rock on Earth is hard enough to resist the forces of weathering and erosion.Weathering (breaking down rock) and erosion (transporting rock material) at or near the earths surface breaks down rocks into small and smaller pieces. These smaller pieces of rock (such as sand, silt, or mud) can be deposited as sediments that, after hardening, or lithifying, become sedimentary rocks.Mudstone, shale, and limestone are examples of sedimentary rock likely to contain fossils. As the layers of sediment build up on top of one another, they create a physical timeline. The oldest layers, along with the organisms that were fossilized as they formed, are deepest. The youngest layers are found at the top.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Q. Which is the BEST evidence that rocks found deep underground were once exposed at the surface? The rocks have been melted by a magma.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Once exposed, they are weathered, both physically (by mechanical breaking of the rock) and chemically (by weathering of the minerals), and the weathering products-mostly small rock and mineral fragments-are eroded, transported, and then deposited as sediments.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Water, ice, acids, salts, plants, animals, and changes in temperature are all agents of weathering. Once a rock has been broken down, a process called erosion transports the bits of rock and mineral away. No rock on Earth is hard enough to resist the forces of weathering and erosion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Weathering (breaking down rock) and erosion (transporting rock material) at or near the earthâ€™s surface breaks down rocks into small and smaller pieces. These smaller pieces of rock (such as sand, silt, or mud) can be deposited as sediments that, after hardening, or lithifying, become sedimentary rocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Mudstone, shale, and limestone are examples of sedimentary rock likely to contain fossils. As the layers of sediment build up on top of one another, they create a physical timeline. The oldest layers, along with the organisms that were fossilized as they formed, are deepest. The youngest layers are found at the top.
