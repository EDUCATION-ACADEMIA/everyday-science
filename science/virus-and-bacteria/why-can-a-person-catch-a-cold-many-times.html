You can also catch it from infected droplets in the air released by a sneeze or a cough.There are over 200 known viruses that can cause the common cold. So even if youve had a cold before, your immune system probably hasnt built up defenses against every virus strain that can lead to a cold. Another reason could be that youre around a lot of people who are sick.A cold virus enters your body through your mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks. It also spreads by hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold or by sharing contaminated objects, such as eating utensils, towels, toys or telephones.This can happen when you shake hands with someone who has a cold, or touch a surface, like a doorknob, that has respiratory viruses on it, then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. You can help reduce your risk of getting a cold: Wash your hands often with soap and water.If you take an antibiotic when you dont need it – for example, when you have a cold or the flu – it can make you feel worse and make your illness last longer. In fact, when used the wrong way, antibiotics can cause more severe illnesses like diarrhea, nausea and rashes.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This can happen by direct physical contact with someone who has a cold, or by touching a surface contaminated with their germs–like a computer keyboard, doorknob or spoon—and then touching your nose or mouth. You can also catch it from infected droplets in the air released by a sneeze or a cough.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-There are over 200 known viruses that can cause the common cold. So even if you’ve had a cold before, your immune system probably hasn’t built up defenses against every virus strain that can lead to a cold. Another reason could be that you’re around a lot of people who are sick.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A cold virus enters your body through your mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks. It also spreads by hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold or by sharing contaminated objects, such as eating utensils, towels, toys or telephones.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This can happen when you shake hands with someone who has a cold, or touch a surface, like a doorknob, that has respiratory viruses on it, then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. You can help reduce your risk of getting a cold: Wash your hands often with soap and water.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-If you take an antibiotic when you don’t need it – for example, when you have a cold or the flu – it can make you feel worse and make your illness last longer. In fact, when used the wrong way, antibiotics can cause more severe illnesses like diarrhea, nausea and rashes.
